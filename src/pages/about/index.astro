    <p class="mt-4 text-lg max-w-3xl">
      Inguz Care provides small, nurturing homes for children and young people who need safety,
      stability and a trusted team around them. We combine calm, homely environments with skilled,
      trauma-informed care so children can feel settled, learn, and thrive.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Our purpose</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        To offer the kind of everyday life every child deserves: somewhere warm and predictable,
        with adults who listen, notice the small things, and champion each child’s strengths—every single day.
