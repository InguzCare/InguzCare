    <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">About Inguz Care</h1>

    <!-- Intro -->
    <p class="mt-4 text-lg max-w-3xl">
      At Inguz Care, we provide small, nurturing homes for children and young people who need safety,
      stability, and trusted relationships. Our homes are calm, warm, and family-like — places where
      young people can feel secure, rebuild trust, and begin to thrive.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-lg max-w-3xl">
      We combine therapeutic care, skilled practice, and meaningful daily life so that every child has
      the opportunity to grow, heal, and experience belonging.
    </p>

    <!-- Our Vision -->
    <div class="mt-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Our Vision</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        Our vision is for Inguz Care to be recognised as a trusted, child-centred home where young people
        can heal, grow, and thrive.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        We aspire to create an environment where permanence, safety, and belonging are the cornerstones of care —
        ensuring that children who may have experienced trauma or instability find the security and consistency
        they deserve.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        We bridge the gap between residential care, therapeutic provision, and secure settings by weaving assessment
        and intervention into everyday life. This holistic and relational model ensures that children are not defined
        by their difficulties, but supported to build confidence, relationships, and life skills for a positive future.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        Growth at Inguz Care is never driven by numbers — it is organic and values-led, grounded in dignity,
        compassion, and excellence.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Our Mission -->
    <div class="mt-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Our Mission</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        Our mission is simple:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        To offer the kind of everyday life every child deserves — one that is warm, predictable, and filled with care.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        A place where adults listen, notice the small things, and celebrate every step forward.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        Through consistency, curiosity, and compassion, we help children rediscover safety, connection, and hope.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Our Ethos -->
    <div class="mt-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Our Ethos</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        At Inguz Care, we believe every child and young person has the potential to thrive, no matter the adversity
        they’ve faced.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        Our ethos is built on relationship-based, trauma-informed practice — we understand that healing happens
        through safe, nurturing relationships and steady routines.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        We cannot replicate a family home, but we strive to feel like one — offering stability, care, and respect
        that help children build positive memories and a sense of belonging.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        We meet the whole child — emotionally, psychologically, physically, educationally, socially, and spiritually —
        and celebrate diversity, identity, and individuality.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        Our approach is grounded in PACE (Playfulness, Acceptance, Curiosity, Empathy) and supported by DBT and
        CBT-informed practice, helping children to manage emotions, develop coping skills, and grow in confidence.
      </p>

    <!-- Why Inguz -->
    <div class="mt-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Why “Inguz”?</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        The name Inguz is inspired by an ancient symbol representing new beginnings and growth.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl">
        It reflects our belief that with the right relationships, structure, and support, every child can move forward
        and shape their own future.
