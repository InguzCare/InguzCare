      At Inguz Care, the heart of any home is the people within it. Our team brings together dedicated,
      trauma-informed professionals who share one purpose: to create a safe, nurturing, and stable environment
      where every young person feels seen, supported, and valued.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 max-w-3xl text-lg">
      We’re assembling a warm, steady, and curious team who approach each day with compassion, consistency,
      and respect — qualities that help children build trust and begin to heal.
