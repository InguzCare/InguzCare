    <!-- Intro -->
    <p class="mt-4 text-lg max-w-3xl">
      At Inguz Care, we provide nurturing, stable homes for children and young people who need
      safety, consistency, and trusted relationships.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-lg max-w-3xl">
      Our approach blends therapeutic, relationship-based care with clear routines, meaningful activities,
      and close partnerships with families, schools, and professionals.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-lg max-w-3xl">
      We believe healing begins when children feel seen, heard, and understood — not when they are managed,
      but when they are met with empathy, predictability, and care.
    </p>

    <!-- Who we support -->
    <div class="mt-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Who We Support</h2>
      <ul class="mt-3 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Children and young people who need a safe, caring home with 24/7 support.</li>
        <li>Those who have experienced loss, trauma, or disrupted attachments.</li>
        <li>Young people with social, emotional, or mental health needs, or those who are neurodivergent.</li>
        <li>Children who benefit from structure, warmth, and gentle consistency.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-4 max-w-3xl">
        Our model is adaptable to each young person’s journey — from short-term stabilisation to longer-term care,
        reunification, or transition to independence.

        <!-- Trauma informed card -->
        <article class="rounded-2xl border p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Therapeutic, Trauma-Informed Practice</h3>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Our practice is guided by the belief, described by Dr. Gabor Maté, that trauma is not the
            event itself, but the internal disconnection it leaves behind. At Inguz Care, we focus on restoring
            connection — to self, to others, and to a sense of safety.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            We use trauma-informed, attachment-aware approaches such as the House Model of Parenting,
            PACE (Playfulness, Acceptance, Curiosity, Empathy), DBT-informed skills, and CBT techniques
            to support emotional regulation, coping skills, and trust.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">The 12-Week Assessment Period</h3>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Each new placement begins with a structured 12-week assessment to help us build understanding,
            create stability, and co-produce a meaningful plan with the young person.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            During these twelve weeks, we establish safe routines, complete multi-disciplinary assessments,
            identify developmental and emotional needs, and create an individualised, evidence-based care plan.
          </p>

        <!-- Education card -->
        <article class="rounded-2xl border p-6">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Education, Health &amp; Wellbeing</h3>
          <p class="mt-2">
            We work closely with education providers to ensure every child has a supported learning plan and
            positive school engagement. Learning happens everywhere — in school, at home, and through everyday experiences.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Health and wellbeing are central to our model. Staff coordinate daily healthcare needs and access external
            support where needed, including play or art therapy, speech and language support, occupational therapy,
            and CAMHS or specialist emotional wellbeing services.

        <!-- Family card -->

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Family &amp; Network Work</h3>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Children thrive when they maintain healthy, meaningful connections. We work collaboratively with families,
            social workers, and professionals to support safe, supported contact and build trust.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2">
            This includes helping children understand their family stories and honouring their culture, beliefs,
            and identity as integral parts of their journey.
